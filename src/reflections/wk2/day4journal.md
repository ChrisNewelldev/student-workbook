-What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Planning ahead helps you avoid time costly mistakes down the road and helps avoid unneeded changes because you already factored them in

-How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Use google, but don't overuse it to the point that you copy and paste code you don't understand.  Break your problem down into simpler bits and reference appropriate documentation

-From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways? 

My biggest takeaways relate to the decision making process of knowing when to spend more time on a problem or look for another solution to solve it.
