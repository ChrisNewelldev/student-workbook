-What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

a function declaration is hoisted
a function expressions aren't hoisted
an arrow function expression is a shorter way to write a function expressions

-What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

parameters are used to define a function 
arguments are the values the function receives from the parameters when functions are invoked

-What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

higher order functions are functions that take another function as a parameter or returns a function.  Array.prototype.map is an example.
