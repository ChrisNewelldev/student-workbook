-What is Scope ?
Scope is where a variable is available to use.  Could be global or within a function

-What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is when a variable is moved to the top of it's scope before running instead of respecting where you put it in your code

-In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
let is block scoped and the preferred way to declare variables. I would use const if i didn't want my variables to change, and I will try not to use var to avoid associated problems.
