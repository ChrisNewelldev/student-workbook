-What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log will print almost anything you want including errors

return helps you see if your functions are defined or not

-Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

the elements tab, it's faster because you can adjust anything in real time instead of going back to your code and saving then refreshing

-Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

using break points and the javascript debugging pane
