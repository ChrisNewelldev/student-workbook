-What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design? 

Avoiding true black.  I've never heard of that before but the link included in the reading explained it well.

-Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I would probably focus on large companies websites that see a lot of traffic like google, any social media company, or tech companies.  Anyone trying to sell good design should have good design incorporated in their own products.

-How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

You can encourage or discourage a lot of actions, a lot of websites have the unsubscribe button much less noticable that the subscribe button using different colors and fonts to try to encourage more users to subscribe.
