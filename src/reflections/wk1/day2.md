-What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
A Pseudo-Class is used to make an element do something special when it's being interacted with, :hover is a good example to change the color of a button or something similar.

-What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is the way CSS knows which rule should apply to an element in the event that multiple parameters are set.  You can use it to your benefit by having different sets of rules apply to different senarios.

-What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you overuse the !important feature you could run into issues with your specificity that you didn't intend.
