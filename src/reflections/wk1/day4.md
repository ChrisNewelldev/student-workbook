-What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing is used at the start of a project to keep the concept user-focused and to clarify to the whole team what website features are expected.

-What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low-fidelity: great for getting a conversation started
mid-fidelity: these get into more detail and can be used to get work started
high-fidelity: gives the dev team great details and actual content to work off.

-Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Usually yes, but it would have to depend on the project.  It would have to be complex enough and usually involve a group to justify the TEE.
